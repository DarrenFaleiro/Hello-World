            The Samsung Odyssey G3 24”, Full HD gaming monitor is equipped with
            AMD Freesync Premium, a 144Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time –
            all to provide a fun gaming experience. If you find your laptop’s
            screen is getting a little too cramped with spread sheets or
            multiple tabs, check for a compatible port.

            The Bose Home Speaker 500 delivers wall-to-wall stereo sound from a
            single speaker. Built-in voice control from the Google Assistant and
            Alexa puts songs, playlists, and more at the tip of your tongue.

            freedom to control the music your way; with your voice, with a tap
            on the top controls, or with the Bose Music app (available on iOS
            and Android).
